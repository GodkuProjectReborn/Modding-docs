# kit change
to get the charID please go to [`charID`](https://github.com/GodkuProjectReborn/Modding-docs/blob/Mods/docs/charID.md)

Search = `xxx;10xxx;30xxx::13`
`xxx` = charID
once the result appear just edit the result that you want
```
10 = blast
30 = blue
50 = green
ultimate has a different id
it starts with 70 and has a random number behind it.
get the other characters 70,yyy to swap ultimates
```
example:
I wanna do UVB:
`554;10554;30554::13`
it would come up with 3 results:
```py
554 # strike
10554 # blast
30554 # blue
50554 # go to any of the other one's and press goto and you'll see this and the ultimate.
```

### this is for game guardian, please do not ask us how to do it as it is right here.
